# Commando 
Commando is the tool that use Cryptographic modules, Contains Symmetric and Asymmetric Ciphers, Hashing algorithms, Cryptographic Protocols, Public-key encryption and signature algorithms to encrypt your data (photos,your scripts,music,python projects ect.) with powerful algorithm encryption.

# What is Cryptography?
Typically Cryptography refers to encryption of plaintext(readable) into ciphertext(unreadable) And the reverse, decryption of ciphertext into plaintext, simple!!
Alternative definition is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.

# Features 
it use Adavance Encryption Standard to protect ur files(AES).
1. Symmetric Cipher
2. 16 byte block size
3. The keys can be 128, 192 or 256 bits long
4. Has many block cipher modes. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation
5. Stands for Initialization Vector

and mch more.........

# Get started

1. git clone https://github.com/mRanonyMousTZ/commando.git

2. cd commando && chmod +X commando.py

3. python3 commando.py


NOTE: make sure all your files that u want to encrypt , should b same directory with commando.py
